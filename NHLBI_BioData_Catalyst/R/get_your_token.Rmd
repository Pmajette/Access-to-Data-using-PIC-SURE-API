# Connecting to BioData Catalyst HPDS resources: manualing setting up a security token


**This Notebook needs to be executed using a python kernel**


To connect to a PIC-SURE network, the PIC-SURE API needs two data: 
- The URL of this network: those notebooks examples are currently using COPDGene-dev network environment, which URL is https://biodatacatalyst.integration.hms.harvard.edu/
- An individual user token, mandatory to gain access to the controlled-access data through the API.


We will hence need to get a token and provide it to the API. First, we create a blank text file called `tokens.txt` that will be used to store the token.

```{r}
file = "token.txt"
if (!file.exists(file)) file.create(file)
```

To actually get the token, process as below:


1. In a web browser, open the BioData Catalyst login page: https://biodatacatalyst.integration.hms.harvard.edu/, and choose one of the available authentication methods to enter it.
2. In the user-interface click on USER PROFILE
3. On the new window, click again on USER PROFILE
4. On the pop-up window, click on REFRESH and then COPY
5. Back into your Jupyter environment, paste it into the newly created text file (`./tokens.txt`).


**The user token is strictly personal, be careful not to share it with anyone**
