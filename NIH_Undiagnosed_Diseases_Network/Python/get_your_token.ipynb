    "Token, an object (in software or in hardware) which represents the right to perform some operation. In computer systems, an [access token](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_token) contains the security credentials for a login session and identifies the user, the user's groups, the user's privileges, and, in some cases, a particular application. Typically one may be asked to enter the access token (e.g. 40 random characters) rather than the usual password (it therefore should be **kept secret just like a password**).\n",
